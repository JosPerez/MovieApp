* Main Architecure: VIPER 
    * I decide to work with VIPER as main architecture. The main resaons is how simple its work with this project architecture, I can be tired setup the flow but once you set up, the complexity od the communnication between modules decrease.
* Framework: BackServices
    * As a new requerement, I decide to create a pod framework located at ""https://github.com/JosPerez/BackServices.git". 
        * Main spec: 
            Architecture: Facade
            The architecture waa decided to simplify access methods from the main app. Also I decide to use Manager to make more simple the main functions for Network, UserDefualt and URLSession. 
            This framework was create from scratch and applied only in this project
* Improvment:
    * The main improvment for this app, is the detail section, I decide to make it simple and compaltible with small devices, but the user expirence can be improved.

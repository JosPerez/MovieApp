# MovieApp
 * Main Architecture: VIPER
   * I decide to work with VIPER as main architecture. The main reason is how simple it is to work with this project architecture. I can be tired setting up the flow but once you set up, the complexity of the communication between modules decrease.
 * Framework: BackServices
     * As a new requirement, I decided to create a pod framework located at ""https://github.com/JosPerez/BackServices.git".
        * Main spec: Architecture: Facade The architecture waa decided to simplify access methods from the main app. Also I decided to use Manager to make the main functions for Network, UserDefualt and URLSession. 
        * This framework was create from scratch and applied only in this project
 * Improvement:
     * The main improvement for this app is the detail section. I decided to make it simple and compatible with small devices, but the user experience can be improved.
